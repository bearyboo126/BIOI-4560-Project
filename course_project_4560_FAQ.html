	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<p>This project is to develop a database of diseases that are associated with a small selection of bacteria from the human 
gut microbiome and what the healthy and unhealthy profiles of these bacteria look like. </p>

	<h2>What diseases are included in this database?</h2>
	<p>Diseases included in this database are: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Ulcerative Colitis (UC), 
and Crohn's Disease (CD).</p>
	
	<h2>Why are relative abundances important?</h2>
	<p>Gut dysbiosis is when the healthy microbial composition and function of the gut is disrupted. 
In illnesses like IBS and IBD, gut dysbiosis is when the beneficial bacteria in the gut is reduced. 
Irritable bowel syndrome is an intestinal disorder that causes bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation. 
It is believed that the gut microbiome may be one of the causes of irritable bowel syndrome, 
but the exact cause of IBS is not known. Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation 
and ulcers in the inner lining of the colon. The causes of ulcerative colitis are not known but it is hypothesized that it 
may be caused by an immune response to a virus or bacteria that causes the immune system to attack the digestive tract. 
Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation in the digestive tract, 
most commonly in the small intestine. It is also hypothesized that this disease may be caused by an immune response to a 
virus or bacteria that causes the immune system to attack the digestive system. IBS, UC, and Crohn's disease usually have 
decreased or increased relative abundance of the microbiome genus. [<a href="#ref-10">10</a>, <a href="#ref-11">11</a>, <a href="#ref-12">12</a>]</p>

	<h2>How is data collected?</h2>
	<p>Microbiome research is usually done using 16s rRNA sequencing or Whole Genome Shotgun Sequencing (WGS).</p>
	<p>16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene is used for sequencing the microbiome as it is in nearly all bacteria by using polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR). [<a href=""#ref-3>3</a>, <a href="#ref-4">4</a>, <a href="#ref-5">5</a>] Its function has not changed, which allows for understanding of bacterial evolution. 
This gene contains nine variable regions, V1-V3 and V3-V5 as used in the Human Microbiome Project. [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>, 
<a href="#ref-2">2</a>, <a href="#ref-5">5</a>] 
16S rRNA provides accurate genus identification but less accurate species identification. 
Other issues with 16S rRNA sequencing are its inability to tell how closely related by sequence similarity other species may be, 
its inability to tell between recently diverged species, and poor-quality data with greater than 2% random sequencing errors. [<a href="#ref-4">4</a>]
	</p>
	<p>Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) sequencing uses random primers to sequence overlapping regions of a genome to provide analysis of 
the entire genome. WGS sequencing has better resolution of taxonomy at the genus and species level compared to 16S rRNA. 
WGS sequencing is less popular than 16S rRNA due to its cost and the time it takes to sort through the amount of data it produces.
 [<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>]</p>

	<h2>How was statistical analysis done?</h2>
	<p>Statistical Analysis for this database was done using MicrobiomeDB, GMrepo, mBodyMap, and NCBI. [<a href="#ref-13">13</a>, 
<a href="#ref-14">14</a>, <a href="#ref-15">15</a>, <a href="#ref-16">16</a>]</p>
	<p> Mean, median, and standard deviation was found for all data. First and third quartiles were found to create an interquartile range.</p>

	<h2>Research Bias</h2>
	<p>Literature that has huge findings about the microbiome's connection to disease may not be completely 
free of bias due to the newer nature of the research, and the statistical methods involved may cause false discovery rates. [<a href="#ref-9">9</a>]</p>

	<h2>What Limitations are there for this site?</h2>
	<p>During this development reproducibility was kept in mind. Unfortunately, the reproducibility of data found 
on NCBI Bioproject varies widely. Many datasets used did not keep good records, 
were not curated, or published but simply dumped onto Bioproject. Medians had to be used from these datasets as 
medians are the least likely to be affected by outliers, when compared to mean and standard deviation. 
The data from these datasets may not be as accurate as it could be due to the limitations of these databases above, 
and the ability to manipulate the data without downloading terabytes worth of datasets, and as such, 
Odin could not be used to store these important datasets to do data manipulation with. 
These issues could be addressed by NCBI Bioproject requirements changing to make it so data must be reproducible. </p>

	<summary>Terms</summary>
	<p> Relative Abundance: is the composition of an organism of a particular kind in comparision to total number of organisms in the
area. Can be expressed as a percentage or as a decimal (with a max of 1.0).</p>
	<p>CFU/g : colony-forming unit per gram. The number of colonies counted per petri dish. </p>
	<p>Differential abundance is the comparison of abundance between two different datasets (control vs. case). [<a href="#ref-8">8</a>-<a href="#ref-9">9</a>] </p>
